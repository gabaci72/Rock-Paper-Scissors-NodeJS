# Rock-Paper-Scissors Web Game with Node.js
## Overview
This project is the graduation project for the NodeJs foundation course.
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors using Node.js. It serves as a basic example of how to create a web server with Node.js and handle HTTP requests.


## What Your Project Does

This project implements a web-based version of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. You can play against the server by making choices through a simple web interface. The game logic is handled entirely on the server-side using Node.js.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/gabaci72/Rock-Paper-Scissors-NodeJS.git](https://github.com/gabaci72/Rock-Paper-Scissors-NodeJS.git)
    cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-NodeJS
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    *(Assuming your main server file is named `app.js`. Adjust if it's different.)*

## Usage

1. **Open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your server runs on).
2. **You will see the Rock-Paper-Scissors game interface.** Use the buttons or links to choose your move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
3. **The server will respond with its choice and the game result.**

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's file structure:

*(Adjust the file names and directories to match your actual project structure.)*

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js:** Runtime environment for the server-side JavaScript code.
* **HTTP Module (`http`):** For creating the HTTP server and handling requests.
* **File System Module (`fs`):** For serving HTML files (if you are doing so).
* **URL Module (`url`):** For parsing URLs and extracting information.
* **HTML:** For creating the user interface.
* **CSS:** (Optional) For styling the user interface.
* **JavaScript:** (Optional) For any client-side interactivity (though the description suggests server-side focus).

## Possible Enhancements

* **Improved User Interface:** Create a more visually appealing and user-friendly game interface using CSS and potentially client-side JavaScript.
* **Game History:** Store and display the game history for the current session or across sessions.
* **User Accounts/High Scores:** Implement user accounts to track scores and potentially create a leaderboard.
* **Different Game Modes:** Explore variations of Rock-Paper-Scissors (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock).
* **Testing:** Add unit tests to ensure the game logic is robust.
