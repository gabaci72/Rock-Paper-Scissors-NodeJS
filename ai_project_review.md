# Letâ€™s review your project work
This AI-generated code review offers specific feedback about your code. You can also ask yourself these same questions when reviewing your code on your own.

## Purpose
Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
* Your code successfully sets up an HTTP server using Node.js and handles both GET and POST requests. It correctly implements the logic for a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, allowing users to play against the server.
* Consider adding more detailed comments to explain the purpose of each section of your code. This will help others (and yourself) understand the flow and logic of your application more easily.
* Ensure that the server handles invalid paths gracefully by providing a more user-friendly message or redirecting to a valid page.

## Readability
Is the code easy to understand?
* Your code is well-structured and follows JavaScript conventions, making it easy to read and understand.
* Consider using more descriptive variable names for better clarity. For example, instead of `url`, you could use `parsedUrl` to indicate that it is a parsed URL object.
>Your Code:<br>
**const url = new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`);**

>Our Suggestion
```js
const parsedUrl = new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`);
```
Add comments to explain the purpose of the `handlePostResponse` function and its logic. This will improve the readability and maintainability of your code.

## Performance
Does the code run efficiently?
* Your implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game logic is efficient and concise, using a switch statement to handle different request paths.
* Consider adding error handling for the file reading operations to ensure that the server does not crash if the files are missing or inaccessible.
 >Your Code:<br>
 **fs.createReadStream("index.html").pipe(response);**
>Our Suggestion
```js
fs.createReadStream("index.html").on('error', (err) => { response.writeHead(500); response.end('Error loading page'); }).pipe(response);
```

## Security
Implement input validation for the POST request to ensure that the user's choice is valid (i.e., 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'). This will prevent unexpected behavior if an invalid choice is submitted.
